# nxxm `belle::vue` : CppCon 2018 slides
Making room for C++ on the Web 

![Demo](./demo.gif)

## Presentation Synopsys
The elegance how a C++17 application can bind to HTML5 will be shown, while running a C++17 data-model on WebAssembly in the server and the browser.

While we will look at the useful libraries, tips and techniques C++17 offers in this context. We will weigh the gains and the pains of modern C++ applied to the HTML5 user experience.

The effective impact on maintainability, performance & lightness of web applications will be measured in comparison to typical web development techniques.
